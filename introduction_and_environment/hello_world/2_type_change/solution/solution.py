# Code your solution here
# Write a python script that contains 2 variables, `x` which is a float, and `y` which is a string representation of a number. 
# Convert `x` to a string, and store this value in a variable called `X`.
# Convert `y` to an integer, and store this value in a variable called `Y`.

x = 1.5
y = "10"
X = str(x)
Y = int(y)
