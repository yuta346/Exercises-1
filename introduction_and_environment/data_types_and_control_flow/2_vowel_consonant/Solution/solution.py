## Problem Description
# Write a Python script that asks the user for a character as input and store this in an object called `letter`.
# Your goal is to check whether the character is a vowel or consonent. Define a variable called `result`, 
# and set this to the string `"vowel"` if the character was a vowel, and `"cosonant"` if the character was a cosonant. 
# Note: Characters can be upper or lowercase letters.
