## Problem Description
# Write a Python script that asks the user to enter an integer value of length and width 
# and store these inputs in variables called `length` and `width`.
# Your goal is to compute the area of the farmer's field and store the result in  variable `area`.


length = int(input("enter length: "))
width = int(input("enter width: "))

# length = 6
# width = 4

area = length*width

print(area)
